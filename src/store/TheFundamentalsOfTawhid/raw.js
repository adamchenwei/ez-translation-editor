WHAT IS THE GREATEST OF ALL OBLIGATIONS IN ISLĀM? 
Lord and Creator, but because they refused to direct their worship to Allāh or they would share their worship between Allāh and their idols and the inhabitants of the graves. So this point has been overlooked by many contemporary Islamic sects. Some Muslims in these times falsely claim that those who call upon the dead in their graves and seek rescue from them are not committing acts of polytheism because they do not believe that the dead created them or that they control the universe, and so long as they believe this, they do not regard their acts as being idolatrous. They claim that these things that they call upon alongside Allāh, whether it be prophets, saints, peers, angels and so on, are merely intermediaries and intercessors between them and Allāh. They claim in their writings and lectures, “We only call upon the saints and the prophets because they are mediators and intercessors between us and Allāh.” This was the very same claim of the idol worshippers in the time of Allāh's Messenger 
Allah stated in the Quran that the polytheists said .(صل الله عليدوس) 
We are often asked, “What is wrong with you people that you're always talking about Tawḥīd and making lengthy discussions regarding it? Why don't you focus upon the state of the Muslims instead? Can't you see how the Muslims are being oppressed around the world? Aren't there more important things to talk about?” In response, we say: Firstly, Tawḥīd (monotheism) is to single out Allāh alone with worship, and it is the very foundation of Islām. So to give Tawḥīd importance is to give the foundation of Islām its true importance. When people disregard Tawḥīd and its true meaning, and oppose what it stands for, calamities befall them. If we were to ponder upon the Qur'ān and what it contains of guidance, we find that it clarifies Tawḥīd completely, so much so that there is not a chapter in the Qur'ān except that it mentions something from the aspects of Tawḥīd, and clarifies that which opposes it. So throughout the Qur'ān, we find information related to the Names and Attributes of Allāh, or we find information related to the actions of Allāh and His Lordship—that He is the sole Creator, Sustainer, Provider and Controller of all of existence. In it we find the command of Allāh to worship Him alone, without associating partners with Him in worship. We also find verses warning of the great danger in associating partners with Allāh in worship (shirk) and the absolute forbiddence of directing worship to other than Him—and that is the greatest of all sins. Additionally, we find that Allāh commands with obedience to Him and His Messenger, Muhammad (legitea jus), and this is from the rights of Tawḥīd. Allāh describes the rewards He has prepared for those who establish Tawḥīd - that they are in eternal gardens of Paradise - and the punishment and torment He has prepared for those who reject it and associate partners with Him in worship - that they are in the eternal Hellfire. So therefore, the whole of the Qur'ān revolves around this fundamental issue of Tawḥīd. Indeed if we 
the call to Tawḥīd and the call to the abandonment of worship of all other gods. And the reason for this great emphasis upon Tawḥīd is due to its great status in Islām. So once this Tawḥīd was deeply rooted in the hearts of the believers, Allāh sent down the rest of the obligations such as Zakāt, fasting, Hajj and the Islamic dress code. And this was because none of these other acts of worship are accepted by Allāh unless they are established upon Tawḥīd. It was for this noble purpose of calling mankind to Tawḥīd that Allāh sent the messengers (Stadiocato), and each of them began their call with Tawḥīd just as Allāh has stated, “Verily, we have sent among every nation a messenger proclaiming: ‘Worship Allāh alone and keep away from the false deities.” (Qur'ān, al-Nahl: 36) and, “We did not send a messenger before you, O Muhammad, except that We inspired them to say that none has the right to be worshipped except Me, so worship Me.” (Qur'ān, al-Anbiyā': 25). And every prophet would say to his people, “O my people, worship Allāh. You have nothing worthy of worship other than He.” (Qur'ān, al-A'rāf: 59). And the same can be said about those who follow the way of the prophets - they also give Tawḥīd the importance that it deserves, and they begin their call with it. Indeed, the purpose of our creation is rooted in the worship of Allāh, as He stated in the Qur'ān, “I did not create the Jinn and mankind except that they worship me.” (Qur'ān, al-Dhariyāt: 56). So if one does not worship his Lord, or he worships others alongside Him, then he has violated Tawḥīd 
and committed the gravest sin in the sight of Allāh. There is huge misunderstanding amongst many Muslims and non-Muslims - they think that Tawḥīd is merely to affirm and recognise the Lordship of Allāh, i.e. that He is the Creator, the Sustainer, Giver of life and death and the Controller of the Universe, and they claim that anyone who affirms this and recognises this, has submitted himself to Allāh and is a believing Muslim. This false notion of limiting Tawḥīd (monotheism) only to the actions of Allāh is actively propagated by some Muslim sects. They do not recognise that the Tawḥīd which Allāh requested from every one of His prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muḥammad (Standorte) was the Tawḥīd of singling out Allāh alone with all worship. Even the idol worshippers in the time of the Prophet (stgate av jus) affirmed that Allāh was the Creator, Sustainer, Giver of life and death, yet they directed worship to other than Him. So the mere affirmation and recognition of one Lord and Creator did not benefit them. Allāh, the Most High, stated in that regard, “Say [O Prophet, to the idol worshippers]: Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Who possesses the hearing and the sights and who gives life to the dead and who is it that gives death to the living and who controls the affairs? They will say, 'It is Allāh'. Then say to them, “Will you not fear!””. (Qur'ān, Yūnus: 31). So the point of dispute between the Messenger Muḥammad (laugate ajo) and the worshippers of idols and graves was not due to their denial that Allāh was the 
about their idols, “We do not worship them, except that they bring us closer to Allāh in rank.” (Qur'ān, al-Zumar: 3). And Allāh, the Most High, said regarding the polytheists, “They worship others besides Allāh, those who cannot harm them nor benefit them, and they say, 'They are our intercessors to Allāh.""' (Qur'ān, Yūnus: 18). In these times we find Muslims falling into this most major of all sins, and they state, “Our calling upon the inhabitants of the graves and our connection with the dead and seeking their aid and assistance is not polytheism; rather, it is a means of nearness to Allāh, and we only seek from them 
intercession because they are Allāh's beloved ones. So they are nothing more than mediators. And this is not shirk (i.e. polytheism), since polytheism is to believe that there is another creator or sustainer besides Allāh.” We must understand that this statement of theirs is the very statement of the polythiests of old as we stated in the verses of the Qur'ān above. Another doubt that we sometimes hear is, “Just because we invoke the dead and seek assistance from them, does not mean we are worshipping them.” Then this statement of theirs is in opposition to the texts. Allāh stated, “And the places of prayer are for Allāh alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allāh.” (Qur'ān, al-Jinn: 18), and He said, “And whoever invokes along with Allāh any other deity has no proof for that. And his reckoning will be with His Lord. Indeed the unbelievers will never prosper” (Qur'ān, al-Mu'minūn: 117). So we are commanded to devote all acts of worship only to Allāh Cergic) and this is because He is the Creator, Sustainer, Giver of life and death, and He is the one who provides sustenance. Allāh stated, “O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He who created you and all those that came before you, so that you may attain piety. He who has made the earth a resting place for you and has made the sky a canopy, and has sent down rain from the sky, and brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provisions for you. So do not set up rivals with Allāh in worship 
we ,(صل الله عليدوس) look at the life of the Messenger Muhammad 
will find that he spent thirteen years of his prophethood in Makkah and ten or so years in Madīnah. The period that he was in Makkah, he spent calling the people to the worship of Allāh and warning them from associating others in worship with Him. During this time, there was no revelation obligating the Zakāt (obligatory charity), nor the fasting, nor the Hajj, nor the veiling, nor the prescribed punishments, nor the rest of the obligations and forbiddences and the affairs related to social interactions; rather these regulations were all revealed after the migration to Madīnah. The notable exception being the prayer (ṣalāh) which was made obligatory shortly before the Messenger's migration from Makkah to Madīnah. So one can clearly see the great focus that Allāh and his Messenger Muhammad aligato a ino) gave to
